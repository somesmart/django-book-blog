<p class="well well-sm">Years ago, like we all are at some time or another, I was struck with the thought "I wonder what happened on my birthday in <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong>". This, naturally, expanded into the idea that I should provide a simple way for everyone to find out what happened on their birthday in <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong>. Currently, I only have data from the first book (9/20 to 2/26) loaded, but hopefully I'll get to the rest eventually. If you notice any errors, let me know!</p>
